Fast Forward:
    You can forward any message with Share Alert from Fast Forward menu item.
    Share Alert now has two additional buttons: forward as copy (Anon Button) and forward without original caption (No-Text Button).
    If you have pre-written comment, then No-Text Button will replace the original caption with your text.
    A long press on both the Anon and No-Text buttons will send the message without sound
    If a selected chat has Drafted Reply, then both Anon and No-Text buttons will send message to this Reply.

    Selected messages can now be forwarded as grouped media.

    Media within webpage previews now can be forwarded as plain media to any chat. Just open the webpage preview and tap the Anon Button from the top.
